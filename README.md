# TUNGBetterSaves
A mod improving saves in TUNG, making load time shorter and save time
significantly shorter (no more waiting 2 minutes after pressing escape).

## How to install
You will need to install [PiTUNG](https://github.com/pipe01/PiTUNG) first.
Then place [```BetterSaves.dll```](https://github.com/Stenodyon/TUNGBetterSaves/releases) in your ```mods``` folder.

## Usage
Better saves transparently replace vanilla saves. If you need to produce a
vanilla save for compatibility purposes, use the ```normalsave``` command in
the in-game console (TAB).
